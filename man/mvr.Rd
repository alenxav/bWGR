\title{
  Multivariate Regression
}
\description{
  Multivariate model to find breeding values.
}
\usage{
  mrr(Y,X)
  mkr(Y,K)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Y}{
    Numeric matrix of observations x trait. \code{NA} is allowed.
  }
  \item{K}{
    Numeric matrix containing the relationship matrix.
  }
  \item{X}{
    Numeric matrix containing the genotyping matrix.
  } 
  
}
\details{
  
 Algorithm is described in Xavier and Habier (2022). The model for the ridge regression (mrr) is as follows:
    
    \deqn{Y = Mu + XB + E}
  
  where \eqn{Y} is a matrix of response variables, \eqn{Mu} represents the intercepts, \eqn{X} is the matrix of genotypic information, \eqn{B} is the matrix of marker effects,  and \eqn{E} is the residual matrix.
  
  The model for the kernel regression (mkr) is as follows:
    
    \deqn{Y = Mu + UB + E}
  
  where \eqn{Y} is a matrix of response variables, \eqn{Mu} represents the intercepts, \eqn{U} is the matrix of Eigenvector of K, \eqn{b} is a vector of regression coefficients and \eqn{E} is the residual matrix.
  
   Algorithm: Residuals are assumed to be independent among traits. Regression coefficients are solved via a multivaraite adaptation of Gauss-Seidel Residual Update. Since version 2.0, the solver of \code{mrr} is based on the Randomized Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Variance and covariance components are solved with an EM-REML like approach proposed by Schaeffer called Pseudo-Expectation. S

  Returns a list with the random effect covariances (\code{Vb}), residual variances (\code{Ve}), genetic correlations (\code{GC}), matrix with marker effects (\code{b}) or eigenvector effects (if \code{mkr}), intercepts (\code{mu}), heritabilities (\code{h2}), and a matrix with fitted values (\code{hat}).
